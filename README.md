1# Intro-to-Computing
Stuff for CIS 1183: Intro to Computing. Has websites and other things


1/19/21 I finally figured out how to upload things!! woo hoo for me!!

Now, this site was for a final. There's nothing too fancy about it, But I do need help with another site that I am making. 
I would prefer that all help would be free as I am a broke college student at time of writing. So yea, also if you want more details (deets) on the site
join my discord server at: https://discord.gg/NzG6BtU. You can also follow me on instagram, Julerobb1. So there you have it, its by no means an origin story. I will soon be adding more content to this account of mine, so stay tuned!

Until we meet again, stay safe, healthy, wear a mask, wash your hands, stay 6ft apart, and get tested/Vaccinated for COVID-19!

Regards,
Lightsnipe
